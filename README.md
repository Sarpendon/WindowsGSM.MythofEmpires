- To give yourself and/or others Admin acces add the Steam ID's after -ServerAdminAccounts=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and separate with ";" if there are multiple admins.

I made a list of all Server Parameters and a Spreadsheet to easaly copy and paste a string to your Server.

You can find all other Server Settings in the "PrivateServerTool" and try around for yourself but it seems that not all Settings work or take affect.
